DeepForest requires csv files used in training to be in a certain format. This Python (version 3.9) code takes images with bounding boxes drawn using Digimap and creates a csv from them, in the format required by the DeepForest package.   
 
Additional packages required are:  
    - numpy  
    - rasterio  
    - pandas  
    - PIL (pillow)  

A Jupyter Notebook is included for an example of how to run the code, so if you wish to use that then Jupyter would also need to be added.
